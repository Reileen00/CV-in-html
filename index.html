        <div class="description">AI/ML engineer and researcher focused on autonomous network control, reinforcement learning, and financial modeling. I
            build agentic systems that blend optimization, intent-driven orchestration, and real-world constraints for 5G/6G telecom
            and fintech use-cases.</div>

            – Designing an agentic AI SaaS platform for intent-based network slicing, dynamic pricing, and QoS assurance
across spectrum/time/power resources.
– Built multi-agent RL (MARL) controllers with Stackelberg game dynamics; integrated PPO, A2C, SAC,
TD3 and meta-heuristics (genetic, swarm) for profit vs. fairness trade-offs.
– Implemented visual analytics: reward curves, welfare/fairness charts, latency/jitter QoS trends, and Pareto
frontiers for NSP vs NSC objectives.

        <div class="subsubheading">Open-source & Systems Projects (github.com/Reileen00)</div>
        <div class="description">
            – Comprehensive Engineering Portfolio: 70+ public repositories across AI/ML, Systems Programming, and
Web3, showcasing consistent learning, implementation, and research initiative.
– Systems Programming: Implemented BitTorrent Client (C++), Term Emulator (C), and Blockchain
(Go) from scratch; explored Rust REST backends, FSMs (Turnstile), and low-level Neural Nets in
C/CPP.
– Artificial Intelligence & ML: Maintained active repositories on Neural Networks (from Scratch), Dive
into Deep Learning (PyTorch), and Reinforcement Learning controllers; built modular pipelines for
experimentation.
– Web3 & Smart Contracts: Designed Upgradeable Proxy System in Solidity (custom
TransparentUpgradeableProxy) with Foundry-based unit tests; contributed to Crowdfunding DApps and
Metamask-style crypto wallet.
– Full-stack & SaaS: Developed multiple 100xDevs-inspired systems — React + Node.js + MongoDB stacks
including authentication, CI/CD pipelines, WebSockets, and SaaS dashboards.
– Regex Engine SaaS: Designed and launched a Regex testing & debugging platform with Freemium + B2B
white-label strategy; built collaborative regex sharing and performance monitoring tools.
– Programming Languages Exploration: Practiced multi-paradigm programming by learning D, Go, Rust,
Solidity, Python, and TypeScript through progressively complex projects.
– Notable Repositories: BitTorrent-Client, Regex Engine SaaS, RustyChat, Blockchain-Go, Turnstile-FSM,
Neural-Nets-in-C, Dappazon, Web3-SaaS, Agent1, AirIntelligence, Reconfiguration-of-Plane-Trees (Computational
Geometry).
– Learning Transparency: Documented all major learning progress publicly — inspired peers to explore
cross-domain systems; achieved GitHub Pull Shark ×2 and YOLO achievements.
